# Termux Setup

This repository contains a series of scripts and files I use to setup my personal termux environment.

## Usage

The script can be run by manually copying it to termux and then executing, or by running the following command:
```sh
curl -L <PUT URL HERE> | bash -
```
Note that curl is preferred over wget as it is pre-installed on termux
